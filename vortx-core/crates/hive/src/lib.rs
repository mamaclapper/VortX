//! # vortx-hive
//!
//! The VortX federation/hive public-plane data model. Self-hosted VortX nodes form a hive that shares
//! FACTS about sources, never about people: a debrid cache map, a federated torrent index, live health.
//! This crate is the pure, portable core of that plane:
//!
//! - [`NodeIdentity`] : an ed25519 keypair; one per node. The node id is `base64url(SHA-256(pubkey)[..16])`.
//! - [`CacheFact`] : a signed claim "infohash X is/ISN'T cached on debrid service Y". Signatures cover a
//!   FIXED canonical byte string (not serialized JSON), so Swift/Go/JS/Rust all produce identical bytes.
//! - [`merge_fact`] : the state-based delta-CRDT merge (LWW by `verified_at` + TTL + clock-skew guard),
//!   commutative/associative/idempotent so it converges regardless of gossip order or duplicates.
//! - [`TrustStore`] : the trust tiers (own > trusted-allowlist > public) and the load-bearing invariant
//!   that a cache claim is actionable only after the node's OWN debrid confirms OR >= 3 independent
//!   trusted signers confirm. A lying peer can waste one re-check but cannot poison playback.
//!
//! Hard rule: share facts, never tokens. A `CacheFact` carries an infohash + a cached boolean, never a
//! resolved, token-bound link. The playable URL is always re-minted locally with the user's own debrid
//! token. The private per-profile sync plane (the shipped Cloudflare E2E backup) is a SEPARATE plane and
//! is never read by, mixed with, or exposed through anything here.
//!
//! This crate is intentionally pure: no networking, no async, no FFI. The `/hive/*` HTTP client, the
//! `FederatedAdapter` Source, and the Cloudflare corpus mirror are later (0.4.0+) phases that build on
//! these frozen, tested types.
