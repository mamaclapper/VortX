# Changelog

All notable changes to VortX, newest first. VortX is Apple TV first, with an iPhone and iPad build alongside it. Dates are when each version was published.

What is planned next is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). To request a feature or report a bug, start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/VortXTV/VortX/discussions) or [open an issue](https://github.com/VortXTV/VortX/issues).

## 0.3.8 Beta 6 - 2026-06-21 (pre-release)

A fix-and-polish beta. The headline is that managing your account from [vortx.tv/dashboard](https://vortx.tv/dashboard) now works the way it should: your whole household, your profiles, and almost every per-profile setting are editable from the web and sync straight to your devices. In-place update, nothing resets. This is a beta, so please install it and report anything off.

### Fixed

- **Continue Watching tracks reliably again.** Progress now records and finished titles clear, even when you resume straight from the Continue Watching rail or after navigating away mid-playback. Two underlying causes are fixed: the engine player is now linked to the right library entry even when the played URL was proxied or routed through AVPlayer (so progress is no longer silently dropped), and a finished movie is marked watched through the library directly (so it leaves Continue Watching instead of lingering).
- **The duplicate "Main" profile is gone.** "Use online account data" could leave two account profiles (a real one plus a leftover "Main") that you could not remove. VortX now keeps a single account profile and quietly retires any leftover, so it becomes an ordinary profile you can delete from the dashboard. This also stops the duplicate from being created in the first place, and never drops your real account profile during the merge.
- **The family contradiction is fixed.** The household card could say you were "not in a family" while creating one said you "already" were. That mismatch (a leftover membership after a household was deleted) now heals itself, and deleting a household fully cleans up so it cannot happen again.

### Dashboard (vortx.tv/dashboard)

- **Every per-profile control is now on the web**, applied to your devices on the next sync: source priority, Kids Mode, stream filters (safe sources, max quality, max file size, instant-only, hide dead torrents, HDR/Dolby Vision only, skip AV1, hide/require words with regex), per-profile add-ons, and your debrid keys.
- **Add-on health at a glance.** The Add-ons page now shows an Online / Slow / Unreachable status for each add-on.
- **Cleaner Library and safer keys.** Library titles no longer appear twice (your VortX and imported Stremio copies are merged), and the metadata API-key fields are masked.

## 0.3.8 Beta 5 - 2026-06-20 (pre-release)

Building on the 0.3.8 account work. The headline is that VortX now speaks **40 languages**, alongside a wave of per-profile and power-user controls: per-profile add-ons, in-app debrid keys, Kids Mode, one-tap quality presets, regex source filters, library export and import, Import from Stremio, Where to Watch, anime skipping, an in-player frame grab, true Dolby Vision on iPhone and iPad, and poster ratings. In-place update, nothing resets. This is a beta, so please install it and report anything off.

### Added

- **Automatic update notifications on every device.** When a newer build is available, VortX now shows a popup once per launch (on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Mac) instead of only flagging it in Settings, and it re-checks once an hour while the app is open so you learn about a release without relaunching. "Get the update" takes you straight to the install. (#90)
- **64 languages.** The interface is now fully localized across 64 languages on top of English, adding Amharic, Armenian, Georgian, Kazakh, Khmer, Nepali, Punjabi, and Swahili to the existing set (Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Azerbaijani, Basque, Bengali, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese Simplified and Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Vietnamese). Choose a specific language in Settings, Language, or follow your device automatically; Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu lay out right-to-left.
- **Per-profile add-ons.** Turn individual add-ons on or off per profile without removing them from your account, so one profile can drop sources another keeps (Add-ons).
- **Add-on health.** Each add-on shows an Online / Slow / Unreachable dot from a live check, with a Re-check button (Add-ons).
- **Kids Mode.** Mark a profile as a Kids profile to always hide adult and CAM/fake sources from it, however its filters are set (Profiles). Pair it with a PIN on your own profile for a full lock.
- **In-app debrid keys.** Add your Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, Premiumize, or TorBox key once; it's stored in your encrypted account and used everywhere, with no separate configuration site (Settings, Debrid services).
- **One-tap quality presets.** Best Quality, Balanced, and Data Saver set the source-type order and quality caps together, so you can pick a taste without tuning each control (Settings, Streams).
- **Regex source filters.** The Hide / Require words can now be full case-insensitive regular expressions (Settings, Streams).
- **Export and import a profile's library.** Save a profile's titles and watch progress to a file and bring it to another device or profile, no account needed (Settings, Backup & Restore).
- **Import from Stremio.** A guided screen that points you to sign-in (which pulls your add-ons, library, and history) and installs several add-ons at once from a list of manifest URLs (Settings).
- **Where to Watch.** The detail page shows where a title streams legally in your region, with provider logos and a link (needs a TMDB key).
- **Anime skip.** Intro, ending, and recap skipping now covers anime via AniSkip (keyed by MAL id), alongside the existing crowd timestamps.
- **In-player frame grab.** A Grab button captures the current frame at full quality and opens the share sheet to save or send it (iPhone, iPad, Mac).
- **True Dolby Vision on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Mac.** A Dolby Vision stream in an MP4, MOV, or HLS container now plays through Apple's AVPlayer for true DV passthrough on a DV-capable display, instead of being tone-mapped to SDR. On iPhone and iPad it routes to the full-chrome AVPlayer surface; on Apple TV to a native AVPlayer screen; on Mac to a native video surface. Direct and debrid sources benefit; MKV releases and torrents stay on the built-in player (which has no Matroska path in AVPlayer), and an AVPlayer load failure falls back to it automatically. Force either engine in Settings, Playback. (#76)
- **Ratings on posters (XRDB).** Optionally overlay ratings, quality badges, and provider logos on your posters from an XRDB instance (Settings).
- **Fourteen seek-bar styles** for how the scrubber looks during playback — Classic, Gradient, Glow, Wave, Heartbeat, Pulse, Dots, Equalizer, Minimal, Neon, Ribbon, Comet, Segments, and Ladder (Settings).
- **One-tap sideload updates.** An AltStore / SideStore source so a sideloaded VortX updates in place.

### Fixed

- **Saved magnets and pasted links attach to the right title**, with a confidence-gated match so a save never lands on the wrong show. (#81)
- **Better audio over AirPods and Bluetooth**, with multichannel handled safely so spatial audio works and stereo-only routes don't drop out. This now applies on both player engines, so a Dolby Vision or HLS stream playing through the system AVPlayer (including on Apple TV) advertises multichannel for Dolby Atmos passthrough and AirPods head-tracked Spatial Audio too, instead of a stereo downmix. (#88, #78)

## 0.3.8 - 2026-06-19 (pre-release)

The big one: a free, end-to-end-encrypted **VortX account**. Sign in and your profiles and settings follow you between devices, the server only ever holds ciphertext. This build fixes the headline problem from the first beta: your devices now actually sync to each other. Plus in-app add-on management, a catalog manager, optional TMDB-powered recommendations, and a batch of fixes. This is a pre-release for testing; QR sign-in on Apple TV and one-tap Stremio sign-in are coming in 0.3.9.

### Added

- **VortX account (optional, end-to-end encrypted).** Create an account, sign in, or recover it from Settings; your password derives the encryption key on-device, so the server can never read your data. Your **profiles and settings sync** across devices, pulled automatically each time you open the app. Manage it (backup/restore, two-factor, change password, connect Stremio, library and add-ons) at [vortx.tv/dashboard](https://vortx.tv/dashboard).
- **Install add-ons in the app.** Paste an add-on's manifest URL in Add-ons to install it, no more leaving for the Stremio app.
- **Catalog manager.** Show, hide, and reorder the catalog rows on Home, per profile (Add-ons, Customize catalogs).
- **Smarter "More like this".** With your own TMDB key (Settings, Metadata), detail-page recommendations blend in TMDB's; without a key it uses the built-in genre and franchise matching. Builds on the new section contributed by [OrigamiSpace](https://github.com/OrigamiSpace). (#89)
- **Save magnets and pasted links for later**, per profile. A saved multi-file torrent reopens its file picker. (#81)
- **A max file-size limit** in Settings under Streams, alongside the max-quality cap. Ask for "1080p but not a 20 GB file."
- **Recent searches on Apple TV.** Contributed by [OrigamiSpace](https://github.com/OrigamiSpace). (#90)

### Fixed

- **Profiles and settings now sync between your devices live, without a relaunch.** Open the app and it pulls and applies the latest from your account, so a profile or setting you change on one device shows up on the others. An earlier beta pulled the data but did not apply it to the running app, so profiles could appear to flip back; that is fixed.
- **Two-factor no longer shows as off in the app** after you enable it; it refreshes its status from the server.
- **The sign-in field reads "Email or username,"** since either one works.
- **Your TMDB and MDBList keys are masked** in Settings instead of shown in plain text.
- **The catalog manager lists your catalogs in their current Home order,** not alphabetically.
- **A macOS crash tied to the window toolbar is fixed** (a conditional toolbar item that could crash during a view update).
- **Playback no longer dies when you lock the screen or leave the app on iPhone/iPad.** Keeping it playing also keeps the streaming server alive, so a torrent survives. Toggle in Settings, Playback. (#74)
- **The Apple TV top menu bar returns reliably** after you scroll a series and press Back. Contributed by [OrigamiSpace](https://github.com/OrigamiSpace). (#75, #91)
- **A macOS crash during trickplay in the background is fixed.** Contributed by [OrigamiSpace](https://github.com/OrigamiSpace). (#93)

## 0.3.7 - 2026-06-16

A small release: a multi-file magnet picker, a macOS search fix, and the move to the VortXTV GitHub organization.

### Added

- **Pick which file to play from a multi-file magnet.** Paste a season pack or playlist and choose a video from the list (name and size), on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. A single-video torrent still auto-plays the best file. (#81)

### Fixed

- **Searching from the home header on Mac now opens the Search tab.** Contributed by [OrigamiSpace](https://github.com/OrigamiSpace). (#80, #82)
- **Apple TV's smart search suggestions now also apply on iPhone, iPad, and Mac**, so a show you are typing surfaces sooner.

### Notes

- The project moved to the **VortXTV** GitHub organization. Old links redirect; stars, forks, issues, and releases carried over.

## 0.3.6 - 2026-06-15

The curvy vortex X everywhere, the VortX gold theme by default, and a macOS custom-server fix.

### Added

- **The curvy vortex X** (two swirling ribbons and a cream center) is now the app icon, the launch screen, and the in-app wordmark on every platform.
- **VortX gold is the default accent** for new installs. If you already picked a theme, it stays.

### Fixed

- **Plain-HTTP custom streaming servers now connect on macOS** (for example a server reached over Tailscale). The Mac build was missing the transport-security exception the iPhone and Apple TV builds already had. (#58)
- **Mac, iPhone, and iPad wait for all sources** before auto-playing the best one, matching Apple TV, so the genuinely best release wins instead of the first to arrive.

### Notes

- Remaining "StremioX" labels in Settings are now "VortX".

## 0.3.5 - 2026-06-15

StremioX is now VortX. This release puts on the new name, a new gold-on-obsidian icon, and an animated VortX intro, and it adds Backup & Restore so your settings can travel with you. It is an in-place update: your library, add-ons, history, and settings stay exactly as they are. A handful of player and Apple TV fixes ride along too, including a smarter best-stream picker.

### Added

- **The app is now VortX.** A new name, a new gold-on-obsidian app icon, and an animated VortX launch screen on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Same app and same account underneath, so nothing resets.
- **Backup & Restore on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.** In Settings you can save your profiles, theme, and playback preferences to a file and restore them later. It is built for the road ahead: your library and watch history always return when you sign in, and this carries your local settings across too. On Apple TV a scan-with-your-phone backup is on the way; for now signing in restores your library there.

### Fixed

- **The Apple TV "Up Next" prompt shows reliably at the end of an episode.** It now takes the corner the moment the credits begin, in place of the old Skip Credits button, so Play Now and Watch Credits are always there when you reach for them, and the buttons no longer wrap or look uneven.
- **The streaming server holds up better under load.** The in-app server gets a larger background worker pool, so busy moments (a torrent and subtitles fetching at once) are less likely to stall it.
- **Best stream is smarter: a true remux now beats a merely bigger file.** The picker ranks source type (remux over Blu-ray over web) and HDR/Dolby Vision and audio above raw file size, with size only breaking ties, so the highest-quality source wins instead of just the largest.
- **The Apple TV "All sources" list scrolls all the way down again** even when the first entry is a non-playable one (like a Ratings add-on).
- **The Apple TV top menu bar comes back reliably** after returning from the Home screen or switching profiles, instead of occasionally staying hidden.
- **Apple TV search suggestions interleave movies and series** instead of listing every movie before the first series, so a show you are typing surfaces sooner. Contributed by [OrigamiSpace](https://github.com/OrigamiSpace).

### Notes

- Next up is VortX in full: the repository and docs move to the new name, with a website, a subreddit, and a Discord to follow.

## 0.3.4 - 2026-06-15

A focused fix pass on top of 0.3.3, across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, clearing the issues found in 0.3.3 testing.

### Added

- **The Quality picker is now in the Apple TV player too.** Swap resolution (4K to 1080p to 720p) at your current position, the same one-tap switch the iPhone, iPad, and Mac player already had.
- **A default external-player picker on Mac and Apple TV.** Choose IINA or Infuse on Mac, or Infuse, VLC, and the others on Apple TV, and direct and debrid streams open straight there.

### Fixed

- **The Skip step setting now shows your choice and takes effect** on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. It was reading the saved value in the wrong format, so the control looked blank.
- **Mac Settings shows the real audio and subtitle labels again,** instead of every row collapsing to "Size".
- **A source with no readable resolution now reads "Other", not "Best",** so a small file is never dressed up as the top pick. A file far too small to be 4K is also no longer tagged 4K.
- **The Apple TV player controls are rebalanced.** Aspect, speed, and source switching moved to the left next to the gear, so the right side is no longer crowded and the skip and audio buttons no longer overlap.
- **The Apple TV "Ends at" clock no longer cuts off** after its first couple of digits.

### Notes

- Landing next: an A/B loop, a frame grab to Photos, sharing a title, copy-all-source-links, a What's New sheet, and haptics.

## 0.3.3 - 2026-06-15

The big player and browse update on top of 0.3.1, across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. A new in-player quality picker, native adaptive-stream playback, a default external-player engine, new-episode alerts, smarter HDR, a full set of source filters, and a long list of on-device fixes (the subtitle freeze and blank posters among them).

### Added

- **An in-player Quality picker.** One tap swaps the resolution (4K to 1080p to 720p and back) at your current position, without reopening the source list.
- **Adaptive streams now play in AVPlayer on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.** An OK.ru-style HLS source ramps to the best quality your connection holds, instead of getting stuck at the lowest rendition.
- **A default external-player engine.** Pick Infuse, VLC, Outplayer, Sen Player, nPlayer, or MX Player, and direct and debrid streams open straight there. A pre-flight check catches a dead link before the hand-off, and you can copy a torrent's magnet link from the same menu.
- **New-episode alerts.** Get notified when a show in your library has a new episode airing. On by default, scheduled on-device, no background tracking.
- **An Up Next band with a countdown** at the end of an episode on every platform, plus next-episode preload on iPhone, iPad, and Mac so the next one starts fast.
- **Smarter HDR and Dolby Vision.** An Auto / On / Off tone-mapping control that checks whether your display actually handles HDR, plus a Dolby Vision profile-7 to profile-8 fallback so more 4K remuxes play instead of failing.
- **Source filters and sorting.** Keyword include and exclude, a safety filter, and new toggles for Instant sources only, Hide dead torrents, HDR only, Hide AV1, and a Max quality cap. Sort the Sources list by Best, Size, or Seeders, and it remembers your choice.
- **A Chapters navigator** in the player with chapter ticks on the seek bar, an "Ends at" clock, and a configurable skip step (10, 15, or 30 seconds).
- **Lock Screen and Control Center controls** on iPhone and iPad (play, pause, skip, scrub, title and artwork), and **keyboard controls in the macOS player** (Space and arrows).
- **Auto-landscape on iPhone and iPad.** The player rotates to landscape the moment a stream opens, even with rotation lock on (with a toggle to turn it off).
- **A richer Playback Info sheet** (what is playing, the add-on it came from, the full release name and filename), a **Cast, Director, and Writer row** on the detail page, and **IMDb rating badges on catalog posters**.
- **Home catalog pagination**, so a large set of catalogs keeps loading as you scroll instead of stopping at the first batch, and **a more prominent update banner** on iPhone and Mac.
- **Seek-while-hidden on Apple TV.** With the controls hidden, Left/Right seek 10 seconds directly with a brief time pill. The options panel also closes after a one-shot pick so you land back on the video, and the Apple TV player buttons gained a frosted Liquid Glass look.

### Fixed

- **Add-on subtitles no longer freeze the app.** A slow or on-demand subtitle source (Submaker, or a laggy OpenSubtitles) used to lock the player while it downloaded. The download now runs in the background with a timeout.
- **Catalog posters no longer go blank.** Tiles that scrolled offscreen and back dropped their image with no retry; they now cache and reload reliably, on Apple TV too.
- **Plain-http custom streaming servers work,** including a server reached over a Tailscale address, which the network layer used to block.
- **The iPhone streaming server stays alive when the screen locks,** so audio keeps playing and the stream survives.
- **Add-on posters that are not 2:3 no longer look squished** on Home, and the Discover grid no longer drops cells when a catalog repeats a title across pages.

### Notes

- Landing next: an A/B loop, a frame grab to Photos, sharing a title, copy-all-source-links, a What's New sheet, and haptics.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-06-15

A bug-fix and polish pass on top of 0.3.0, driven by on-device testing across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. The headline wins: movies query every add-on again, and the embedded streaming server holds up on iPhone and Apple TV (debrid and torrent).

### Fixed

- **Movies now query ALL your add-ons (iPhone and Mac).** A title from a TMDB-based catalog carries a TMDB id, and stream add-ons keyed to IMDB ids were silently skipped for it, so only a couple answered. StremioX now resolves the title's IMDB id (the same one official Stremio uses) before requesting sources, so every add-on is queried. Apple TV was unaffected. If a movie still shows only a couple of add-ons, the Sources list names the ones that errored or returned nothing.
- **The embedded streaming server is harder to kill on iPhone and Apple TV, on debrid too.** On these platforms the server runs inside the app, and its memory footprint includes the player's read-ahead buffer, so even a debrid (direct) stream could push the whole app past the iOS/tvOS limit. The read-ahead is now smaller (128 MB, 96 MB on the 2 GB Apple TV HD) and the seek-back buffer trimmed, on top of the raised memory ceiling, fewer torrent connections, and the one-tap server restart in Settings.
- **Watched episodes tick again across a binge on Apple TV.** Auto-advancing through a season marked only the session's first episode watched; every episode now marks (the detail-page ticks update accordingly).
- **Source rows show the release filename again**, so you can tell "Part 1" from "Part 2" instead of just the quality tags.
- **HDR no longer washes out after an in-place episode switch.** Auto-advancing or skipping between two HDR episodes re-applies the HDR output reliably, instead of occasionally staying in SDR until a fresh replay.
- **Continue Watching, Next, and Previous now pick the best source, not the first to answer.** The player waits for add-ons to settle before choosing, so resuming or switching episodes lands on the quality you were watching (the 4K, not a stray 1080p), and the in-player Sources button reliably appears on a Continue Watching resume.
- **Continue Watching resume gets the in-player episode controls** (Next, Previous, and the episode list), the same as playing from the detail page.
- **Source rows no longer show the resolution twice** when an add-on is named after a quality.

### Added

- **Audio Passthrough**, now reachable both in Settings (Audio Output) and from the in-player Audio control: bitstream Dolby and DTS to an AV receiver that decodes them. Surround mode still decodes them to multichannel PCM, the fix for a soundbar that drops DTS to stereo.
- **Richer source rows**: the HDR variant (Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10), audio (Atmos, TrueHD, DTS-HD), channel layout, and codec, matching what Stremio shows.
- **Local scrub-preview thumbnails**, captured while you watch, so dragging the seek bar shows a frame preview even without a server storyboard. Contributed by OrigamiSpace.
- **Scroll arrows on catalog rows** (Mac, and iPad with a pointer), so a long row is easy to page through without a trackpad swipe.
- **A bigger iPhone hero billboard**, and a sticky release group across episodes. Both iPhone and Mac keep the 0.3.0 translucent top bar (the immersive bleed treatments tried on each were reverted).
- **Binge continuity on Continue Watching**: resuming a series, and its in-player Next / Previous, now keep the same release group across episodes, not just the same resolution.

### Also fixed

- **The iPhone hero billboard rotates again** instead of occasionally freezing on one title after switching tabs.

### Notes

- A wave of new player and browse features (an in-player quality picker, a default external-player engine, an Up Next autoplay band, and more) is landing next.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-06-14

StremioX is now a native app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac alongside Apple TV, all on the same stremio-core engine and libmpv player. This milestone retires the old iPhone and iPad web host. The beta entries below list the iPhone polish that led here; the headline additions and fixes are collected here.

### Added

- **In-player next and previous episode, an episode list, and end-of-episode auto-advance** on iPhone, iPad, and Mac (Apple TV already had it). Episodes switch in place, with no reload flash, and carry the resume position and quality forward.
- **Sleep timer.** Pause after 15 to 90 minutes, or stop at the end of the current episode.
- **A native macOS menu bar.** A Go menu with keyboard shortcuts (Command 1 to 5 for the tabs, Command F for Search), Settings on Command comma, and Check for Updates.
- **A translucent, frosted top bar on iPhone browse screens**, so the hero and content read as scrolling under the chrome.
- **A streaming-server log in Settings** (iPhone and iPad), so when the embedded server stops you can see and share why.
- **The launch animation now plays on iPhone, iPad, and Mac**, matching Apple TV.

### Fixed

- **The streaming server is far less likely to be killed mid-playback on iPhone.** Its torrent cache is now scaled to the device instead of a fixed 512 MB; on iPhone the server shares the app's memory, so an oversized cache plus 4K video could push the app past the system limit and force a restart.
- **Finishing one episode of a series no longer clears the whole series from Continue Watching.** Only finishing a movie or the last episode clears it.
- **Series and shows find their sources, not just movies**, and what you watch lands in Continue Watching and resumes where you stopped.
- **Source rows no longer show the resolution twice** and show a fuller release title.
- The iPhone detail and episode pages no longer clip at the screen edges; video fills the iPhone screen correctly; ratings and backdrops appear for TMDB-catalog titles; the featured hero shows one clean backdrop; the accent theme persists across relaunches; and upscaled video is sharp again (all detailed in the betas below).

### Notes

- Up next: next-episode pre-search and sticky release-group auto-play, an animated hero background, an HTTP/HLS quality selector, wider iPad and Mac layouts, a fuller accessibility pass, and more of the quality audit.

## 0.3.0 beta 15 (prerelease) - 2026-06-14

More iPhone polish, all verified on an iOS build.

### Added

- **The launch animation now plays on iPhone, iPad, and Mac**, matching Apple TV, over the engine and streaming-server boot.
- **Continue Watching long-press now offers "Details".** A Continue Watching card plays on tap, so the menu now also opens the detail page where you can pick a different episode or source, alongside "Remove from Continue Watching".
- **A server log in Settings.** Settings > Streaming Server > Server log shows the embedded server's status and recent output (with copy), so when the server stops on a device you can see and share the exact reason.

### Fixed

- **The video fills the screen on iPhone.** A 16:9 stream left thick black bars on the sides in landscape; the iPhone player now fills the screen. iPad, Mac, and Apple TV keep the whole frame (letterboxed), and the player's Aspect control still switches between them.
- **Hero buttons stopped squishing into vertical slivers.** After the iPhone width fix, the Trailer / In Library / Sources chips on a detail page could compress until their labels stacked vertically; they now keep their shape and wrap to a new line when space is tight.

### Notes

- Next: pinning down the streaming server stopping on some devices (the new server log will show why), in-player next/previous episode, an HTTP/HLS quality selector, and the rest of the 100+ item audit.

## 0.3.0 beta 14 (prerelease) - 2026-06-14

The iPhone pass. Every fix below was reproduced and verified on an iOS build, not just the Mac.

### Fixed

- **Series and shows find their sources now, not just movies.** Movies resolved sources but episodes came up empty, because opening an episode pushed a new screen and the detail page behind it tore down the engine's loaded title a fraction of a second later, wiping the streams the episode page had just fetched. The detail page no longer does that, so an episode loads its full ranked source list (one test episode went from "no sources" to 65).
- **The detail and episode pages no longer clip off the screen edges on iPhone.** In portrait, the title, rating line, buttons, and synopsis were cut off on both sides. The page is now hard-pinned to the screen width and the facts line truncates cleanly, so nothing runs off the edge. (Landscape, iPad, and Mac were already fine.)
- **What you watch lands in Continue Watching, and remembers where you stopped.** The iPhone, iPad, and Mac player never told the engine your playback position, so nothing showed up in Continue Watching and resume did nothing. It now reports progress to the engine the same way Apple TV does.
- **Movie pages no longer show the Watch / Quality / Sources controls twice.** The hero already has them, so the source list below now shows just the grouped per-add-on sources.
- **Ratings, logos, and backdrops now appear for TMDB-catalog titles.** On Home, Discover, and Library, titles from a TMDB catalog (including everything in Continue Watching) showed no rating and no backdrop, because the hero looked for that art before your add-ons had finished loading and never tried again. It now refreshes once add-ons are ready, matching Apple TV.
- **The featured hero shows one clean backdrop.** It used to layer a sharp still over a blurred copy of the same image, which read as two overlapping pictures. It is now a single full-bleed backdrop.
- **Your theme color sticks.** Changing the accent color and reopening the app reset it to the default; the chosen color now persists across relaunches.
- **Sharper video.** The player had been forcing a low-quality "fast" scaling profile that softened upscaled video; that override is gone, restoring the crisp image from the 0.1.6 build.

### Notes

- Still sequenced for the next build: surfacing the embedded server's log in Settings to pin down the streaming server dying on some devices, in-player next/previous episode, an HTTP/HLS quality selector, a Continue Watching "Details" option, a startup animation on iPhone/iPad/Mac to match Apple TV, and the rest of the 100+ item audit (docs/REVIEW-WORKLIST.md).

## 0.3.0 beta 13 (prerelease) - 2026-06-14

The build that fixes "no sources", plus the macOS player and the featured hero.

### Fixed

- **Titles find their sources again, on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.** This was the big one: opening an episode (or a movie) often showed "no sources" even with stream add-ons installed and working, because the app was never actually asking the add-ons. When a series was already loaded, tapping an episode skipped the stream request entirely, and movies leaned on a fragile auto-guess. Both now request the right streams every time, so a title that has sources shows them. Game of Thrones S1E1 went from nothing to over 1,800 sources across every installed add-on.
- **The macOS player works.** It crashed the instant you pressed Play (a missing internal dependency once the player was lifted to fill the window), and the "play a link" dialog drew on top of it. The player now opens full-window inside the app, plays, and closes cleanly without resizing the window, with the same controls and engine as Apple TV.
- **The featured hero shows the whole backdrop.** On a wide Mac window the hero art was either zoomed into a sliver or boxed in by bars. It now shows the full still over a soft blurred fill, so nothing important is cut off, and the detail page got a taller, less-cropped band.
- **Shows display their logo as the title.** Where logo artwork exists, the hero uses the show's logo (Game of Thrones and friends) instead of plain text, and it appears right away.
- **"No sources" explains itself.** When nothing loads, the screen now says whether each add-on returned nothing, errored, or whether no stream add-on responded at all, and what to check, instead of a generic dead end.

### Notes

- Still sequenced for upcoming builds: the hero reading ratings and logos for every title from the engine, a translucent top bar so the backdrop flows under it, in-player next/previous episode, an HTTP/HLS quality selector, and the rest of the 100+ item audit (docs/REVIEW-WORKLIST.md).

## 0.3.0 beta 12 (prerelease) - 2026-06-14

The real fix for the streaming server dying, plus Continue Watching metadata.

### Fixed

- **The streaming server no longer dies seconds after launch (issue #56).** This was a crash, not a memory problem: it happened on an 8 GB iPhone with the torrent cache barely touched. Our embedded server starts a small reverse proxy on port 11471 so the older web UI can load over a loopback origin, and that proxy's listen() raised an unhandled EADDRINUSE error event when a previous instance still held the port (a fast relaunch, or force quit then reopen), which crashed the whole node runtime and took the streaming server down with it. The native iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps have no web UI, so they no longer start that proxy at all, and it now handles the error where it does run. The server otherwise runs the same configuration Stremio runs (an earlier attempt to disable its HTTPS and transcode subsystems was the wrong lead and has been reverted).
- **Continue Watching titles now show their details in the featured hero.** A title carried in from Continue Watching used to appear in the rotating hero with just its name and a Play button, no rating, year, genres, or synopsis. The hero now fetches that metadata up front, so it is ready before the title rotates into view.

## 0.3.0 beta 10 (prerelease) - 2026-06-14

Working down the full audit, plus a dedicated macOS pass.

### Fixed

- **Finished titles now leave Continue Watching.** The player never told the engine a title was watched, so movies and episodes lingered in Continue Watching at their end position forever. It now marks a title watched at ~90% and, when a movie or the last episode finishes, removes it from the rail, matching the Apple TV app.
- **On macOS, closing the window quits the app.** Before, the red close button / Cmd-W left the app running headless with the streaming server still holding its port and no way to get the window back. Closing the last window now quits cleanly and shuts the server down.
- **Return submits on Mac.** Pressing Return in the password field or the streaming-server URL field now submits, instead of doing nothing.
- **Destructive red no longer reads as orange.** The Remove / Log Out / error red was warm enough to look like a leftover orange accent next to a cool theme; it is now a cooler red.
- **VoiceOver reads poster cards.** Each poster announces its title, that it opens details, and its watch progress.

### Notes

- Still sequenced for upcoming builds (each is a focused, separately-tested change): the macOS player presentation, in-player next/previous episode, an iPad/Mac wide-screen layout, engine thread-safety hardening, and the rest of the accessibility pass. The full list lives in docs/REVIEW-WORKLIST.md.

## 0.3.0 beta 9 (prerelease) - 2026-06-13

The one from the full audit. A 7-area review (layout, code, player, theming, server, parity, accessibility) found 97 issues; this build lands the systemic root-cause fixes and every crash.

### Fixed

- **The viewport clipping is fixed at the source, on every screen.** beta8 fixed Home/Discover/Library; the same root cause (a plain VStack inside a scroll view stretching to its widest row) still clipped the Profile editor, the "Who's watching?" picker, Search, and Sign In. All now pin to the screen width. The Add Profile screen, which rendered cut off on both edges, is verified correct on device.
- **The accent now fully recolors.** Button labels and on-accent text kept a warm/orange tint on top of any accent (the "still looks orange after switching to pink"). The on-accent ink is now derived from the accent itself, so a pink or blue theme is pink or blue throughout. Ember keeps its signature warm ink.
- **Two crashes removed.** Opening the Subtitles/Audio panel on a dual-track title, and any networking path that built a URL from a runtime value, are now guarded instead of force-unwrapped.
- **Sign-in is hardened further.** The signed-in flag is only written when it actually changes, closing the last path that could re-enter an observer (the class of bug behind the beta7 sign-in freeze).

### Notes

- This is the first of several builds working through the full audit. Still queued: the macOS player presentation, in-player next/previous episode, marking titles watched so they leave Continue Watching, an iPad/Mac layout that uses the wider screen, and a full accessibility pass.

## 0.3.0 beta 8 (prerelease) - 2026-06-13

The one that fixes the phone. beta 7's real-device testing surfaced an app-freezing sign-in bug and a cluster of iPhone-only layout breakage, and this is the fix pass for all of it.

### Fixed

- **QR / link sign-in no longer freezes and crashes the app.** On iPhone and iPad, finishing a QR sign-in could hang the whole app (no buttons, the phone itself lagging) and then crash. Root cause: the sign-in handler wrote a value that re-triggered itself in an unbounded loop on the main thread. It now runs exactly once. (macOS was unaffected: it has no main-thread watchdog, which is why it only showed on the phone.)
- **Discover and Library no longer render shifted off the left edge.** On iPhone the whole screen (hero, filter chips, poster grid) could be pushed left and clipped on both edges, intermittently. The content column now pins to the screen width instead of stretching to its widest row. Verified on device.
- **The streaming server stops crashing seconds after launch on iPhone.** The embedded server was starting subsystems the phone build never needs (a second HTTPS server and its certificate stack), inflating its memory footprint until iOS killed it. The iPhone/iPad build now runs the same lean configuration the official Stremio iOS app uses.
- **The Add-ons screen and Streaming Server screen fit the phone.** They were using the 10-foot Apple TV screen inset and a fixed 1000pt-wide field, so content spilled off the edge and the "Remove" button was squeezed to one letter per line. They now use a phone-appropriate inset, the field fits, and the button keeps its width.
- **The featured hero no longer shows a flat black band** while its backdrop loads or if that image fails. It falls back to the poster art underneath.

### Notes

- "None of the add-ons returned a playable source": this means no streaming or debrid add-on is installed. Metadata-only add-ons do not provide playable streams. Install a stream or debrid add-on from the Stremio web or mobile app and it syncs down.

## 0.3.0 beta 7 (prerelease) - 2026-06-13

The one that actually plays. beta 6 shipped with a macOS player deadlock, and this fixes it.

### Fixed

- **The macOS player no longer freezes the whole app.** Starting a video could hang the entire app (spinning beachball, even Quit dead) and require a force-quit. Root cause: mpv's video-output thread set the layer's HDR/EDR flag via a blocking hop to the main thread _while holding the Metal layer lock_, exactly as the main thread tried to take that same lock to size the drawable, a hard deadlock at the first frame. The EDR flag now updates without blocking the render thread, so playback starts cleanly. Verified end-to-end (open → play → controls → close) with a real video stream.

## 0.3.0 beta 6 (prerelease) - 2026-06-13

A stability and polish pass over the native iPhone, iPad, and Mac apps, fixing the issues reported on beta 5.

### Fixed

- **The player can no longer trap you.** On a slow or dead source the controls used to auto-hide behind the spinner with no way out, so a stuck load meant force-quitting the app. There is now an always-present close button (and Escape on Mac) until playback starts, the controls stay on screen while loading, and every exit cleanly cancels in-flight work.
- **Torrent movies that hung at "loading" now start.** The player warms up a cold torrent (waiting for peers and the first few megabytes) before handing it to the engine instead of buffering forever, shows the live peer count while it does, and still fails over or errors out if the torrent is genuinely dead. The torrent prime also retries while the streaming server is still starting up.
- **Trailers play again.** The old in-app YouTube embed failed with "Error 153"; the Trailer button now opens the trailer reliably (and a real, non-YouTube trailer stream plays in the built-in player).
- **Settings no longer look unfinished.** The section cards use the app's dark surface and the accent colour instead of the system grey, on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
- **The wordmark fits its pill.** The "StremioX" title in the Mac window bar no longer spills past its rounded background, and renders once instead of repeating.
- **A signed-out Home is now a real landing screen.** It shows the default Cinemeta catalogs with a full backdrop hero and rails, with the Sign In button still in place, instead of an empty "please sign in" page.
- **QR / link sign-in is safer.** A rejected or expired link code is rejected instead of flipping the app into a broken signed-in state.

### Changed

- **The featured hero is an ambient billboard.** It rotates through top titles on its own, never auto-selects or rings a catalog item, and pauses the moment you interact; tapping a poster just opens it.
- **Player polish toward Apple TV parity:** the Audio panel opens for any audio track (not only when there is more than one), and the screen stays awake during playback.

### Housekeeping

- Local builds now go to a single output location, so development builds stop registering several duplicate app copies with the system.

## 0.3.0 beta (prerelease) - 2026-06-13

The native iPhone, iPad, and Mac apps reach Apple TV parity, and StremioX expands to desktop and Android. iPhone, iPad, and Mac now run the same stremio-core engine and libmpv player as the Apple TV app, with no web host.

### Added

- **Native iPhone, iPad, and Mac apps at Apple TV parity.** The cinematic detail page with the backdrop, the per-add-on source list with the two-level quality picker, full Settings (Profiles, Account, Playback, Streams, Streaming Server, Appearance, Audio and Subtitles, Subtitle Style), and a custom bottom tab bar so iPhone shows every tab instead of collapsing them into "More".
- **An interactive featured hero on Home, Library, and Discover.** It auto-rotates the top titles, shows the logo, rating, year, runtime, genres, and synopsis over the artwork, and plays a muted trailer behind it; tap a poster to feature it, tap again to open. Reduced-motion aware.
- **Trailers on every Apple device.** A Trailer button on the detail page and the muted in-hero autoplay; Apple TV plays trailers through the embedded server, iPhone, iPad, and Mac through an in-app player. (Full build only.)
- **Series done right on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.** Tapping an episode opens its own ranked source list with the quality picker; watched ticks, progress stripes, mark-watched (episode, season, whole series), a Resume S#E# button, and the first-unwatched season selected on open.
- **Torrents on Mac.** The Mac app bundles the streaming server, so it plays torrents, not just debrid and direct links.
- **Continue Watching one-tap resume** straight into the player at your saved position, poster long-press menus, Library type and sort filters, and grouped search with suggestions and a "play a link or magnet" entry.
- **Desktop (Windows, Linux, Mac) and Android in active development.** A native Tauri desktop app on the shared engine (detail page, ranked sources, the quality picker, and its own embedded torrent server) and an Android app scaffold.

### Fixed

- **macOS:** torrent and episode playback (the client now primes the streaming server before requesting a stream and carries add-on proxy headers); the window opens at a proper size and the player fills it in-app instead of a tiny floating panel; the keychain permission prompt is gone (the token is stored in a file on macOS); and the embedded server is shut down on quit instead of leaking.

## 0.2.49 (prerelease) - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Torrents play again, and the streaming server stops going offline. Auto-failover was leaving each tried torrent's engine running on the embedded server; a few hops piled up engines until the server's memory ballooned and it stopped responding, which broke torrent and direct-server playback until a relaunch. The player now cleanly shuts down a torrent's engine the moment it switches source, fails over, advances an episode, or closes, so only one runs at a time and the server stays healthy.
- App text size now actually changes, live. Settings, Appearance has a Smaller / Larger stepper (percent shown); it repaints the whole app immediately instead of doing nothing.
- Navigating into a title and back out no longer traps a tab. Returning to Search (or any tab) lands on its own page, not the detail page you opened earlier.
- Fake "4K" files are filtered out. A source that claims 4K (or 1080p) but is far too small to be real video is pushed below every genuine source, so a mislabelled tiny file is never auto-picked. Lower resolutions, where small files are normal, are left alone.

### Added

- Subtitle fine-size control. A Smaller / Bigger stepper in Settings and in the player's subtitle options nudges subtitle size around the chosen preset; the size follows your profile.
- The external-player handoff lists more players (Infuse, VLC, Sen Player, OutPlayer, nPlayer, MX Player), and if none are detected it shows the full list so you can still pick the one you have.
- Header-gated add-on streams route through the embedded streaming server. Some add-ons front CDNs that only answer requests carrying a specific referer or browser identity and reject plain players; those streams now play by going through the same server-side proxy the official app uses. (Full build only; the Lite build keeps the direct path.)
- Language-aware ranking. When a source clearly advertises a foreign audio language and you have a preferred audio language set, it ranks below a same-quality-tier source in your language, so a 1080p English source can be chosen over a 4K source in another language. Cached and your source-type order still come first.

## 0.2.48 - 2026-06-12

The 0.2.45 through 0.2.48 prereleases, consolidated.

### Added

- Auto-failover between sources. When a stream times out, keeps stalling, or dies before starting, the player hops to the next-best source on its own (up to four hops) and keeps your position, instead of dropping you at an error screen. A deliberate source pick or episode change resets the budget.
- Player settings panel. A gear button on the left of the control bar holds the player-wide tools: handoff of the playing stream to an installed external player app, a hardware/software decoder switch for clips whose video misbehaves, the playback info overlay, and the QR link share. The speed button now holds only speed.
- Live streams play properly. Live TV and event streams no longer end a few seconds in at each segment boundary: the player tunes its buffering for live playlists and reconnects over the brief gaps live providers produce. Contributed by [OrigamiSpace](https://github.com/OrigamiSpace).
- Subtitles from add-ons. The player's subtitles panel lists subtitles offered by your installed subtitle add-ons next to the file's embedded tracks; pick one and it loads on the spot, labelled with the add-on it came from.
- Swipe to navigate in the player. The remote's touch surface moves the selection across the controls and panels, exactly like the arrow presses.
- Source type priority in Settings, Streams. A reorderable list puts debrid, Usenet, torrent, or direct streams at the top (default Debrid, Usenet, Torrent, Direct). Your order is the top-level ranking key; cached streams get a strong boost within each type, so cached always beats uncached of the same type without overriding your order.
- Use add-on ranking order toggle. Passes stream order through unchanged, useful if a ranking add-on already sorts sources the way you want.
- Smarter ranking signals. Theatrical rips and fake upscales (CAM, telesync, screener families) sink below every legitimate stream and are labelled in the source list; AV1 video is demoted at 4K where the hardware cannot decode it; 3D releases, broadcast captures, and hardcoded-subtitle rips rank below clean releases; raw torrent health (seeder count) breaks ties within the torrent tier.
- Subtitle font choice. A new Modern style (clean sans with a thin outline and soft shadow) is the default; Classic keeps the previous heavier look. In Settings and in the player's subtitle options.
- App text size setting. UI text sits one step larger by default, and Settings, Appearance has a Smaller / Default / Larger control; takes effect after a relaunch.
- Languages follow the profile. Audio language, subtitle language, and the subtitle style belong to each profile, apply on switch, and sync across devices. Requested by [heinzgruber](https://github.com/heinzgruber).
- Profile edit guardrail. A profile with a PIN asks for that PIN before anyone else can edit it, so a kids profile cannot rename the parent profile or strip its PIN.
- Browse backdrops restored on all hardware. The moving artwork on the Home and catalog pages is no longer suppressed on the Apple TV HD; only the player-side buffers and animation rate remain lighter on that model.

### Fixed

- Add to Library genuinely works now. The save action was silently doing nothing (a wrong key when reading the page state), which is why no profile could save. Both the save and the immediate button update now happen everywhere.
- Stream ranking stops picking failures. Cached debrid streams no longer lose to uncached torrents of the same quality; cache tags are detected across every major add-on's format, including a variation-selector emoji form that previously never matched; uncached results that resolve through a debrid are no longer mistaken for cached ones; and debrid streams with unbracketed tags no longer fall into the direct tier and lose to raw torrents.
- The Watch button tells the truth. An explicit resolution in the name beats marketing tokens, so a 1080p encode of a UHD disc no longer reads or ranks as 4K, and the label carries the full picture, like "Watch in 4K · HDR · Remux", derived from the exact stream it plays.
- Streams that require special request headers now play. Some add-ons front servers that reject requests without a specific referer or browser identity; the player sends the headers the add-on declares, the same way the official clients do. Fixes "This source didn't load" on add-ons whose streams play fine elsewhere.
- Subtitles can no longer silently vanish. Both subtitle styles name fonts bundled with the app; naming a system-only font could fail on some devices and render no subtitles at all.
- The Continue Watching long-press menu is back on secondary profiles, and removing a title there touches only that profile's own history, never the main account's library.
- The detail page stays inside the TV-safe area. On TVs that crop the picture edges (overscan), the top of the detail page could be cut off; content now respects the safe margins while the backdrop artwork still fills the screen.
- Two rare crash paths in the player and engine teardown are hardened: a remote-control event arriving at the exact moment the player closes, and an engine event racing app shutdown, can no longer touch freed memory.

### Performance

- Ranking patterns compile once and each stream's score is computed once and remembered; a long source list re-ranked on every refresh had been doing thousands of pattern compilations on the thread that drives the remote. Detail pages also stop re-ranking on every periodic progress save, and an idle sources panel does no work at all.

### Changed

- The CJK subtitle font is trimmed to its practically-used coverage: 7.6 MB instead of 16 MB, with identical rendering for real-world subtitles. Every build gets smaller, and every build keeps full CJK subtitle support.
- Vendor downloads in the build script are now checksum-pinned, so a tampered or corrupted dependency fails the build instead of shipping.

## 0.2.44 - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- Torrents no longer take the streaming server down. A torrent streams from the local server, which already buffers the file, so the player's large read-ahead was double-buffering it in memory until the system killed the app. Read-ahead is now sized to the source: small for local torrent playback, full for debrid and direct streams.

### Added

- Automatic performance mode for older Apple TVs. The app detects a memory-constrained Apple TV (the Apple TV HD) and switches to a lighter path on its own so the remote stays responsive: the play head updates less often, the moving backdrop is dropped on browse, and buffers are kept tight. Every Apple TV 4K is unaffected. Settable by hand under Settings, Appearance, Performance.

### Changed

- The Lite build's identifier is now `com.stremiox.tv.lite`, and the CI artifacts follow. Installing 0.2.44 Lite over the previous Lite build creates a fresh app rather than updating in place. The Full build is unaffected.

## 0.2.43 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Watch Now picks the genuinely best source. Ranking now weighs file size (a bitrate proxy) and lossless audio (Atmos, TrueHD, DTS-HD), so it stops settling for a basic 4K from whichever add-on answered first.
- Smooth, predictable scrubbing. Holding to seek glides across the timeline at an even pace instead of jumping by varying amounts.

### Fixed

- Audio reaches the TV and soundbars over HDMI eARC. The player now claims a movie-playback audio session, which fixes setups with no sound and lets multichannel audio reach a receiver.
- In Settings and the profile editor, pressing Down moves to the next row even when the focused item sits off to one side.

### Changed

- The slimmer Apple TV build is now StremioX Lite (it was StremioX Direct).

## 0.2.41 - 2026-06-11

A large consolidated release.

### Added

- Add to Library and Watch Later from any movie or series page and from Continue Watching.
- A Details action in the Continue Watching long-press menu.
- A stream-link QR code in the player to keep watching on your phone.
- A richer source list with size and quality per source, capped per add-on so one provider cannot bury the rest.
- An HDR and Dolby Vision compatibility toggle for displays that show a remux green or purple.

### Fixed

- Add-on torrents now receive the same TCP and TLS trackers as pasted magnets, so they can find peers where plain UDP discovery is blocked.
- The sources panel no longer freezes the player when opened.
- No more brief home screen flash before the profile picker on launch.
- Marking a whole series unwatched clears every episode tick.

## 0.2.35 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- A Direct Links Only mode and a separate lighter build (later renamed Lite) for debrid and direct links only.
- Per-series quality memory, so a series reopens in the quality you last played.
- HTTPS torrent trackers for peer discovery without UDP.

### Fixed

- Binge auto-next stays on the same release group, so quality never jumps mid-season.

## 0.2.24 to 0.2.27 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Seamless watching: Continue Watching resumes the exact stream and position, the next episode is preloaded and warmed before the credits, and the embedded server wakes itself after sleep.
- A Relaunch button in Settings, playback speed, a live playback-info overlay, and a richer source picker.
- Paste any link to play it (magnet, direct URL, resolved debrid or usenet).

### Changed

- Profile PINs are stored as a salted hash and never shown.
- The update checker rechecks on a sensible schedule and surfaces new releases in Settings.

## 0.2.0 to 0.2.23 - 2026-06-09 to 2026-06-10

### Added

- The native Apple TV client on the engine: Home, Discover, Library, Detail, the full per-add-on source list, Search, and add-on management.
- Skip intro and outro from crowd-sourced timestamps merged with the file's chapters.
- The cinematic full-bleed redesign and the living backdrop on Home, Discover, and Library.
- The two-level quality picker and ranked Watch Now with instant preloaded auto-play next.
- Profiles: a "Who's watching?" picker, per-profile themes and history, an optional PIN, and per-profile accounts.
- Real HDR and Dolby Vision output, and the embedded streaming server for torrents.
- Brand identity, an animated splash, and QR sign-in.

### Fixed

- A device crash while a popular title's large source list loaded.
- A crash a fixed number of seconds into heavy 4K playback.

## 0.1.7.5 to 0.1.7.15 - 2026-06-08 to 2026-06-09

The player foundations.

### Added

- Smart audio and subtitle selection, language-grouped track pickers, subtitle styling and sync, and bundled fonts for every script.
- Long-press library menus, in-player source switching, and player auto-recovery on a stall.
- Eight accent themes plus a true-black OLED mode.
- Skip intro and outro from chapter markers, a seekable scrubber with hold-to-seek, and a screensaver hold-off during playback.
