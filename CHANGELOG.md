## 0.2.45 (prerelease) - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- Add to Library now reflects immediately. After tapping the button the page updates to show the title is saved, without requiring a reload. Affected all profiles.
- Stream ranking no longer penalises cached streams from debrid services. A bad penalty was knocking cached debrid streams below uncached torrents of the same quality; Watch Now and the 4K button now correctly prefer the faster source.
- Two rare crash paths in the player and engine teardown are hardened: a remote-control event arriving at the exact moment the player closes, and an engine event racing app shutdown, can no longer touch freed memory.

### Added
- Auto-failover between sources. When a stream times out, keeps stalling, or dies before starting, the player now hops to the next-best source on its own (up to four hops) instead of dropping you at an error screen. A deliberate source pick or episode change resets the budget.
- Player settings panel. A gear button on the left of the control bar opens a new panel holding: handoff of the playing stream to an installed external player app, a hardware/software decoder switch for clips whose video misbehaves, the playback info overlay, and the QR link share. The speed button now holds only speed.
- Subtitle font choice. A new Modern style (clean sans with a thin outline and soft shadow) is the default; Classic keeps the previous heavier look. In Settings and in the player's subtitle options.
- Source type priority in Settings, Streams. A reorderable list lets you put debrid, Usenet, torrent, or direct streams at the top. The default order is Debrid, Usenet, Torrent, Direct.
- Use add-on ranking order toggle. Turning it on passes stream order through unchanged, useful if you use a ranking add-on that already sorts sources the way you want.
- Smarter ranking signals. Theatrical rips and fake upscales (CAM, telesync, screener families) now sink below every legitimate stream and are labelled in the source list; AV1 video is demoted at 4K where the hardware cannot decode it; 3D releases, broadcast captures, and hardcoded-subtitle rips rank below clean releases; raw torrent health (seeder count) breaks ties within the torrent tier.
- Browse backdrops restored on all hardware. The moving artwork on the Home and catalog pages is no longer suppressed on the Apple TV HD; only the player-side buffers and animation rate remain lighter on that model.

### Changed
- The CJK subtitle font is trimmed to its practically-used coverage: 7.6 MB instead of 16 MB, with identical rendering for real-world subtitles. Every build gets smaller, and every build keeps full CJK subtitle support.
- Vendor downloads in the build script are now checksum-pinned, so a tampered or corrupted dependency fails the build instead of shipping.

## 0.2.44 - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- Torrents no longer take the streaming server down. A torrent streams from the local server, which already buffers the file, so the player's large read-ahead was double-buffering it in memory until the system killed the app. Read-ahead is now sized to the source: small for local torrent playback, full for debrid and direct streams.

### Added
- Automatic performance mode for older Apple TVs. The app detects a memory-constrained Apple TV (the Apple TV HD) and switches to a lighter path on its own so the remote stays responsive: the play head updates less often, the moving backdrop is dropped on browse, and buffers are kept tight. Every Apple TV 4K is unaffected. Settable by hand under Settings, Appearance, Performance.

### Changed
- The Lite build's identifier is now `com.stremiox.tv.lite`, and the CI artifacts follow. Installing 0.2.44 Lite over the previous Lite build creates a fresh app rather than updating in place. The Full build is unaffected.

## 0.2.43 - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Watch Now picks the genuinely best source. Ranking now weighs file size (a bitrate proxy) and lossless audio (Atmos, TrueHD, DTS-HD), so it stops settling for a basic 4K from whichever add-on answered first.
- Smooth, predictable scrubbing. Holding to seek glides across the timeline at an even pace instead of jumping by varying amounts.

### Fixed
- Audio reaches the TV and soundbars over HDMI eARC. The player now claims a movie-playback audio session, which fixes setups with no sound and lets multichannel audio reach a receiver.
- In Settings and the profile editor, pressing Down moves to the next row even when the focused item sits off to one side.

### Changed
- The slimmer Apple TV build is now StremioX Lite (it was StremioX Direct).

## 0.2.41 - 2026-06-11

A large consolidated release.

### Added
- Add to Library and Watch Later from any movie or series page and from Continue Watching.
- A Details action in the Continue Watching long-press menu.
- A stream-link QR code in the player to keep watching on your phone.
- A richer source list with size and quality per source, capped per add-on so one provider cannot bury the rest.
- An HDR and Dolby Vision compatibility toggle for displays that show a remux green or purple.

### Fixed
- Add-on torrents now receive the same TCP and TLS trackers as pasted magnets, so they can find peers where plain UDP discovery is blocked.
- The sources panel no longer freezes the player when opened.
- No more brief home screen flash before the profile picker on launch.
- Marking a whole series unwatched clears every episode tick.

## 0.2.35 - 2026-06-11

### Added
- A Direct Links Only mode and a separate lighter build (later renamed Lite) for debrid and direct links only.
- Per-series quality memory, so a series reopens in the quality you last played.
- HTTPS torrent trackers for peer discovery without UDP.

### Fixed
- Binge auto-next stays on the same release group, so quality never jumps mid-season.

## 0.2.24 to 0.2.27 - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Seamless watching: Continue Watching resumes the exact stream and position, the next episode is preloaded and warmed before the credits, and the embedded server wakes itself after sleep.
- A Relaunch button in Settings, playback speed, a live playback-info overlay, and a richer source picker.
- Paste any link to play it (magnet, direct URL, resolved debrid or usenet).

### Changed
- Profile PINs are stored as a salted hash and never shown.
- The update checker rechecks on a sensible schedule and surfaces new releases in Settings.

## 0.2.0 to 0.2.23 - 2026-06-09 to 2026-06-10

### Added
- The native Apple TV client on the engine: Home, Discover, Library, Detail, the full per-add-on source list, Search, and add-on management.
- Skip intro and outro from crowd-sourced timestamps merged with the file's chapters.
- The cinematic full-bleed redesign and the living backdrop on Home, Discover, and Library.
- The two-level quality picker and ranked Watch Now with instant preloaded auto-play next.
- Profiles: a "Who's watching?" picker, per-profile themes and history, an optional PIN, and per-profile accounts.
- Real HDR and Dolby Vision output, and the embedded streaming server for torrents.
- Brand identity, an animated splash, and QR sign-in.

### Fixed
- A device crash while a popular title's large source list loaded.
- A crash a fixed number of seconds into heavy 4K playback.

## 0.1.7.5 to 0.1.7.15 - 2026-06-08 to 2026-06-09

The player foundations.

### Added
- Smart audio and subtitle selection, language-grouped track pickers, subtitle styling and sync, and bundled fonts for every script.
- Long-press library menus, in-player source switching, and player auto-recovery on a stall.
- Eight accent themes plus a true-black OLED mode.
- Skip intro and outro from chapter markers, a seekable scrubber with hold-to-seek, and a screensaver hold-off during playback.
