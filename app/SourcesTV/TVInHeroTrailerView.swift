/// In-hero auto-play trailer for the **tvOS** detail page (#44), the parity twin of the iOS / iPad / Mac
/// `InHeroTrailerView`. tvOS has no WKWebView, so the YouTube IFrame embed the touch surfaces use cannot
/// run here; this plays whatever DIRECT URL it is handed through **libmpv**. NOTE: tokenless YouTube
/// extraction is dead, so `TrailerRequest.playableURL` now yields only a direct (non-YouTube) stream here
/// (the dead `/yt` route was removed); a YouTube-only trailer has no URL and the layer simply never mounts
/// (still backdrop stays) until the `trailer.vortx.tv` resolver lands. See TrailerRequest.swift.
///
/// A muted, looping, chromeless libmpv layer fades in OVER the still backdrop a short beat after the hero
/// appears, the same ambient treatment iOS gives. The still art underneath is the permanent fallback, so a
/// missing / slow / blocked clip never leaves the band black.
///
/// Two loop modes (the owner's clip-scope answer): pass `window` for a short SILENT WINDOW (the DETAIL hero
/// shows a ~8s snippet, the parity of the iOS detail's `.clip(start:window:)`), or leave it nil for the whole
/// muted trailer on a built-in `loop-file=inf` loop (the HOME featured hero). The same view serves both so
/// the home + detail heroes share one decorative libmpv layer.
///
/// Gating + fallback (mirrors iOS exactly):
///   • The caller gates on the `stremiox.autoplayTrailers` setting + `accessibilityReduceMotion`, and only
///     mounts this view when a trailer exists, so reduced-motion / setting-off never starts a clip.
///   • The clip plays only when the embedded server is reachable (checked async on appear). On the Lite
///     build (`STREMIOX_NO_EMBEDDED_SERVER`) there is no `/yt` route, so `TrailerRequest.playableURL` is
///     nil and the caller never builds this view — it cleanly no-ops to the still backdrop.
///   • If libmpv reports a load failure (`endFileError`, e.g. ytdl extraction failed), the clip hides and
///     the still backdrop stays.
///
/// tvOS focus / RemoteCatcher invariant: this layer is purely decorative. It is NON-focusable, takes no
/// hit-testing, and holds no `@FocusState`, so it never enters the focus path or competes with the player's
/// focus engine. The hero's title / actions remain the focusable, accessible content.
///
/// Lifecycle: a dedicated lightweight libmpv `Coordinator` is created per mounted instance and torn down
/// when the view disappears (SwiftUI dismantles `MPVMetalPlayerView`, which calls `stop()`), so the preview
/// never leaks a player or holds the streaming server busy. Keyed on the trailer URL so navigating A -> B
/// rebuilds the layer for B rather than painting A's clip over B's backdrop.
