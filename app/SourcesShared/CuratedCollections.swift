/// dropped from `collections`, and a fully empty result leaves the previous rails in place rather than

/// network simply shows no editorial rails, never an error or a spinner stuck on screen.
///
/// The catalogs come from Cinemeta's public `top` / `imdbRating` catalogs (optionally genre-filtered),
/// resolved through the existing `AddonClient`, so every card carries a real Cinemeta id and taps
/// straight into Detail / playback through the engine, exactly like an add-on catalog card.
