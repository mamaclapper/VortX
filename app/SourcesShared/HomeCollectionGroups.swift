/// Nested collections (grouped Home rails): a SECOND tier above the flat add-on/editorial rails, where
/// related rails are gathered under a big group header. The owner's structure, in this exact order, is:
///
///   1. "Streaming"  — the streaming-service rails (Netflix, Disney+, …) from `StreamingRailsModel`.
///   2. "Genres"     — a handful of top genres (Action, Comedy, Drama, …) from TMDB /discover-by-genre.
///   3. "Top New"    — the most popular movies + shows released in the last few months (TMDB popularity).
///   4. "New"        — the freshest movies + shows by release / air date (TMDB date-desc).
///
/// This is purely ADDITIVE and empty-state safe. The whole grouped section renders BELOW the existing
/// flat Home rails (Continue Watching, Top Picks, Upcoming Episodes, the engine board rows, the editorial
/// rails). Each group resolves independently; a group whose rails all came back empty is dropped entirely,
/// and a group that needs a TMDB key (Genres / Top New / New) simply doesn't appear when no key is set
/// (the Genres group additionally falls back to the keyless Cinemeta genre catalogs, so it can still fill).
/// The engine-owned flat rails are never touched, so with no key + no network the Home is byte-for-byte
/// unchanged from before.
///
/// Every card is a `MetaPreview` carrying a resolved Cinemeta `tt` id, so a tap routes to `DetailView` and
/// plays through the engine exactly like every other rail card — no new card type, no new routing.
