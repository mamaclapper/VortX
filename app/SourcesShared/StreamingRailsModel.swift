/// "Browse by streaming service" Home rails (Nuvio-style): one rail per major streaming service (Netflix,
/// Disney+, Prime Video, Max, …) filled with what is actually available on that service in the viewer's
/// region, from TMDB's watch-provider (JustWatch) data. This is DISCOVERY/categorization: a card on the
/// "Netflix" rail is a title that streams on Netflix, but tapping it plays through the engine (add-ons /
/// debrid) like every other card - VortX never plays Netflix's own streams.
///
/// Built entirely client-side from the configured TMDB key, mirroring `CuratedCollectionsModel`: each rail
/// resolves independently, an empty rail is dropped, and a fully empty build leaves the previous rails in
/// place. With no TMDB key the whole section stays empty (the Home views hide it), exactly like Top Picks.
/// Every TMDB id is resolved to a Cinemeta `tt` id so cards play through the engine (the `tmdb:`-id trap:
/// a raw tmdb id only resolves with a TMDB meta add-on installed, so we drop titles with no IMDb id).
